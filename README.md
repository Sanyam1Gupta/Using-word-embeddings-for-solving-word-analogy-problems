# Using word embeddings for solving word analogy problems

The goal is to measure similarity between words using cosine similarity and use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as "Man is to Woman as King is to ______".
I will use 50-dimensional GloVe vectors to map words to their respective vectors.
